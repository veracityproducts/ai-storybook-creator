You will:
- Keep the story centered on the given title and theme
- Use only the ApprovedWords and HeartWords supplied; never use words outside these lists
- Keep sentences short, concrete, and age-appropriate for 4-6
- Avoid complex morphology, multisyllabic words, or punctuation beyond the allowed set
- If a concept requires an unavailable word, substitute with available words or simplify the idea
- Always return exactly the requested JSON with no extra commentary
```

**Story Generation Prompt:** `prompts/story-json.md`
```
Create a decodable reader titled "Big Pig" for ages 4-6 about: A big pig sits and digs.

Phonics constraints:
- Graphemes allowed: ["i", "b", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "p", "r", "s", "t", "v", "w", "x", "z"]
- Only use words from ApprovedWords or HeartWords. Do not use BannedWords.
- Sentences per page: 1–2. Keep sentences short and concrete.
- Allowed punctuation: [".", "!", "?"].
- Proper nouns policy: none.
- Maintain decodability; avoid morphology not introduced.
- If it is impossible to express a concept with the allowed lexicon, simplify or choose an alternative using only Allowed words.

ApprovedWords: ["it", "is", "if", "in", "big", "dig", "fig", "gig", "jig", "pig", "rig", "wig", "bid", "did", "hid", "kid", "lid", "rid", "bin", "din", "fin", "gin", "kin", "pin", "sin", "tin", "win", "bit", "fit", "hit", "kit", "lit", "pit", "sit", "wit", "dip", "hip", "lip", "nip", "rip", "sip", "tip", "zip", "bib", "fib", "jib", "nib", "rib"]

Return JSON only with this shape:
{
  "title": "...",
  "pages": [
    { "text": "..." , "imagePrompt": "..." }
  ],
  "moral": "..."
}
```

**Gemini Response:**
```json
{
  "title": "Big Pig",
  "pages": [
    {
      "text": "I see the big pig. It is a big pig.",
      "imagePrompt": "A big pink pig in a farm setting"
    },
    {
      "text": "The big pig can sit. The pig did sit.",
      "imagePrompt": "The big pig sitting on the ground"
    },
    {
      "text": "The big pig can dig. The pig did dig in the dirt.",
      "imagePrompt": "The big pig digging in the dirt with its snout"
    }
  ],
  "moral": "Big or small, we can all do things we set our minds to."
}
```

---

## Step 5: Decodability Validation

### Role: Validation System (Deterministic Code)

**Process:** Validate each word against approved lexicon

**Validation Results:**
```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "issues": [],
  "offendingWords": []
}
```

**Analysis:**
- Page 1: "I" (heart), "see" (❌ NOT IN LEXICON), "the" (heart), "big" (approved), "pig" (approved), "It" (heart), "is" (approved), "a" (heart), "big" (approved), "pig" (approved)
- **Issue Found:** "see" is not in approved words for CVC short-i pattern

---

## Step 6: Story Repair Process

### Role: Repair Agent (Gemini 2.0)

**Repair Prompt:** `prompts/guardrail-repair.md`
```
The story contains words not allowed in the phonics pattern. Rewrite the story using ONLY the approved words.

  "sampleCount": 2,
  "enhancePrompt": false,
  "addWatermark": true
}
```

Draft handler wiring (pseudo-code only; not applied):
```ts
// inside image generation loop
const imageOptions = {
  apiKey,
  model: "imagen-4.0-fast-generate-001",
  aspectRatio: "3:4",
  personGeneration: "allow_adult",
  negativePrompt: body.negativePrompt,
  sampleCount: Math.min(Math.max(body.sampleCount ?? 1, 1), 4),
  enhancePrompt: body.enhancePrompt ?? false,
  addWatermark: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? true : (body.addWatermark ?? true),
  // DEV ONLY
  seed: (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production' && body.addWatermark === false) ? body.seed : undefined,
}

const { base64, mimeType, variants } = await generateImagenImage(finalPrompt, imageOptions)
// If sampleCount > 1, select best variant by heuristic (face/wardrobe/style checks)
```


**Imagen Response:** Base64 encoded image data

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Request Flow
```
User Request → Phonics Config → Style Bible → Story Generation → Validation → Repair (if needed) → Image Generation → Book Compilation → Response
```

### Error Handling
- **Pattern Not Found:** Falls back to manual configuration
- **Validation Failure:** Automatic repair up to 3 attempts
- **Image Generation Failure:** Placeholder images with error logging
- **API Timeout:** Graceful degradation with partial results


Note: The Character DNA registry is defined in lib/phonics-patterns.ts (entries: Sam_v1, Emma_v1, Mom_v1, Dad_v1, Pig_v1). The composeDNA(dna) helper builds a single, stable descriptor block used in prompts. Default characterMappings map common tokens (e.g., "man", "Sam", "I", "he", "woman", "Emma", "she", "Mom", "Dad", "pig") to these composed DNA profiles. Verbatim reuse rule: inject the DNA text exactly as-is in every page prompt; only the scene/action changes per page.

### Caching Strategy
- **Style Bibles:** Cached per title/theme combination
- **System Tokens:** Loaded once at startup
- **Phonics Patterns:** Static configuration, no caching needed

### Security Considerations
- **Content Safety:** All prompts include child-safety guidelines
- **Input Validation:** Strict schema validation on all inputs
- **Rate Limiting:** Implemented at API gateway level
- **Image Storage:** Public URLs with content-type restrictions

---

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### 1. System Prompts
- **Role Definition:** Clear specialist role (literacy specialist)
- **Constraints:** Explicit lexicon restrictions
- **Output Format:** Strict JSON schema enforcement
- **Fallback Instructions:** Handle impossible concepts gracefully

### 2. Style Consistency
- **Detailed Descriptions:** Comprehensive character descriptions
- **Style Anchoring:** Strong style keywords at prompt beginning
- **Token Extraction:** Distill style bible to essential keywords
- **System Tokens:** Consistent modifiers for all images

### 3. Character Mapping
- **Detailed Descriptions:** Full physical appearance details
- **Consistent Naming:** Map all pronouns and variations
- **Animal Characters:** Avoid human children for content policy
- **Family Dynamics:** Include parent/family character options


### 4. Character DNA (Versioned Descriptors)
- Define each recurring character with a stable, versioned descriptor (e.g., Sam_v1) structured across five layers:
  1) Identity foundation (name/role/species)
  2) Physical signature (facial structure and features, body proportions, distinctive markings)
  3) Style identity (clothing, accessories, color scheme)
  4) Behavioral markers (common expressions, poses, personality)
  5) Context envelope (lighting preferences, rendering style)
- Prompts must reuse the exact Character DNA text verbatim; only the scene/action changes.

### 5. Style Lock Prompt Pattern (Imagen 4)
- Opening anchor: front‑load core style tokens (e.g., “Bright vibrant 3D animation…”)
- Identity block: include full Character DNA immediately after the anchor
- Scene/action: concise page‑specific action and context
- Mid‑prompt reinforcement: one short clause to restate style (“maintain the same Pixar‑like 3D style, smooth textures, warm daylight”)
- System tokens + closing emphasis: composition/safety tokens and a short quality closer

### 6. Negative prompts (Imagen 4)
- Add a negative prompt line to reduce failure modes:
  - “no extra limbs, no text overlays, no brand logos, no weapons, no frightening faces, no deformed anatomy, avoid harsh shadows”
- Keep LLM prompt rewriting disabled (enhancePrompt off) to avoid altering Character DNA.

### 7. Development determinism (seeds) — optional
- For local R&D only: use a fixed seed with watermark disabled to evaluate DNA baselines.
- Production: do not rely on seeds (watermark must be enabled); expect some variability.

### 8. Multi‑variant selection (sampleCount)
- Optionally request 2–4 variants per page and select the best match.
- Heuristics (human or automated):
  - Face/feature fidelity to Character DNA
  - Wardrobe/accessory match
  - Style/lighting match to tokens
- Keep sampleCount small (2 is a good default) to control cost.

- Upgrade: Offload long-running image workflows to background jobs (e.g., Vercel Queues) and poll from UI
- Upgrade: Use Edge Runtime for short, CPU-light endpoints (style tokens) to reduce latency
- Upgrade: Add rate limiting and request deduping (e.g., middleware + in-memory/Redis token bucket)

### PDF Export (jsPDF + html2canvas)
- Upgrade: Server-side HTML→PDF rendering with Playwright/Puppeteer for print-perfect layout, fonts, and hyphenation
- Upgrade: Declarative PDFs with @react-pdf/renderer for component-based layouts and better pagination control
- Upgrade: Post-process with pdf-lib (merge, bookmarks, metadata, embed fonts/images)
- Upgrade: Generate both portrait (A4/Letter) and printer spreads; add bleed/crop marks for print

### Reader UI (React + shadcn/ui + Tailwind)
- Upgrade: Framer Motion for page transitions (fade/slide) and reduced motion support
- Upgrade: Pinch-zoom and pan for images on mobile (react-zoom-pan-pinch)
- Upgrade: Keyboard and gesture navigation (arrow keys, swipe) with accessible focus states
- Upgrade: Locale/i18n scaffolding (next-intl) and RTL support

### Notifications (sonner)
- Upgrade: Integrate Sentry for error tracking + session replay; surface errors via toasts with retry CTA
- Upgrade: Add progress toasts tied to background jobs (start → progress → success/failure)
- Upgrade: Centralize UX patterns (success/info/warn/error) and timeouts in a toast utility

### Validation Engine (deterministic TypeScript)
- Upgrade: Add morphological/inflection guards (e.g., forbid -ing/-ed unless enabled)
- Upgrade: Per-page unique word caps and running-tally across book
- Upgrade: Export validator as a standalone package with unit tests and fixtures

### Caching & Performance
- Upgrade: Cache style bibles/tokens in Redis (e.g., Upstash) to cut LLM calls on repeats
- Upgrade: Add HTTP caching headers for public image assets and the book JSON
- Upgrade: Preload hero assets and defer non-critical JS on the /book page

### Styling & Theming
- Upgrade: Adopt Radix Colors (consistent tokens) and design tokens via CSS variables
- Upgrade: Add high-contrast theme and improved focus outlines for a11y

### Testing & CI
- Upgrade: E2E tests with Playwright (book generation happy path, PDF export smoke)
- Upgrade: Unit tests with Vitest for validator and prompt assembly helpers
- Upgrade: Pre-commit hooks (Husky) for typecheck, lint, and tests

### Analytics & Observability
- Upgrade: Vercel Analytics (zero-config) for page usage; add custom events for Generate/PDF
- Upgrade: OpenTelemetry traces for compile-book pipeline (span per step)
- Upgrade: Cost dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana or simple Supabase table) to monitor $/book
